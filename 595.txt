#Use "UNION" operation is faster than using "OR"
#when it comes to cases like scan two different column like this.
#Reason is MySQL usually uses one one index per table in a given query, 
#so when it uses the 1st index rather than 2nd index, 
#it would still have to do a table-scan to find rows that fit the 2nd index.
