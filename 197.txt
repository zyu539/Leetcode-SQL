#Approach 1 Use DATEDIFF (slow)

SELECT
    weather.id AS 'Id'
FROM
    weather
        JOIN
    weather w ON DATEDIFF(weather.date, w.date) = 1
        AND weather.Temperature > w.Temperature;
        

#Approach 2 Use TO_DAYS (fast)

SELECT wt1.Id 
FROM Weather wt1, Weather wt2
WHERE wt1.Temperature > wt2.Temperature AND 
      TO_DAYS(wt1.DATE)-TO_DAYS(wt2.DATE)=1;
